# LncPipeTestData

This repo contains a test case for running LncPipe.  

# Data Information   

Only a subset of the whole dataset (trimmed for chrX only) were put on this repo for improving testing efficiency for LncPipe. 
The file includes  

* Fastq files with properly named `Fastq/*.gz`  

* Genome reference from GENCODE `Genome/chrX.fa` 

* Hisat2 index of the genome reference `Genome/hisat2Index*.ht2`, generated by following command  

        hisat2-build chrX.fa chrX  
    
* GENCODE ANNOTATION file `Genome/gencode.v25.annotation.chrX.gtf`

* LncPipedia ANNOTATION file `Genome/lncipedia_4_0.chrX.gtf`

* Experimental design file `design.file`

* nextflow running config file `singularity.config`

* A singularity image `lncPipe.image` that storing all required environment


# Test command  (singularity and nextflow should be preinstalled)

* Pull the test data 

        git clone test
        cd LncPipeTestData

* Pull the lastest lncPipe  

        git clone https://github.com/likelet/LncPipe.git 

* Run the analysis command  

        nextflow -c singularity.config run LncPipe/LncRNAanalysisPipe.nf -with-trace -resume -with-timeline timeline.html
